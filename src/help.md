   pdfjs.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = `//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/${pdfjs.version}/pdf.worker.js`;

   const PDFViewer = ({ pdfUrl }) => {
     const [pdf, setPdf] = useState(null);

     useEffect(() => {
       const loadPdf = async () => {
         const loadingTask = pdfjs.getDocument(pdfUrl);
         const pdf = await loadingTask.promise;
         setPdf(pdf);
       };

       loadPdf();
     }, [pdfUrl]);

     return (
       <div>
         {pdf ? (
           <div>
             <h2>PDF Loaded</h2>
             {/* Render PDF pages here */}
           </div>
